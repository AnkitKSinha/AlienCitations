    <p class="abstract">To find out the names of those people who have cited a paper and are unknown to the author, using the citation graph.
A citation is a reference to a published or unpublished source which was consulted when a paper was written. A citation network or a citation graph is a representation of the nested levels of citations, where the nodes represent the papers and an edge between 2 nodes depicts the citation link. A citation network is often used to extract important information about the papers and authors in the network, such as the most influential paper. With a small modification, a citation network can be used to find out the Alien Citations. A network for such a problem would contain authors as nodes and an edge between them depicting the citation link. To extract the alien network from the complete citation network, nodes containing the names of known author have to be deleted. These known authors can be which can be a colleague, guide or a student to the author. Alien Citations is a new method for evaluation of an authors productivity by considering his citation impact, and the measure of it contributes to the overall h-index of the author. One of the uses of this method can be seen in the Visa Office. The Visa office now requires recommendations from people we dont know. Using Alien Citations we can extract the list of such people and a third party can contact them and ask if they are willing to write the recommendation. Another use can be in a social networking domain. Alien Citations can contribute in finding the genuinity of a trending tweet, or a viral post on Facebook.</p>
